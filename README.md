# Syllogism Solver
In my Formal Logic course, the book includes this challenge:

> Work through the 256 forms of syllogisms in Appendix B, using counterexamples to determine validity. There are 232 invalid forms and 24 valid ones. As you work through them, remember that if you cannot figure out a counterexample, it is either valid or you need to be more creative. Also, you would be greatly assisted in working through them more quickly if you recall what you learned about the relationships between statements. Good luck!

I decided to solve the challenge in a different way. I read the next couple of chapters, learned the rules for determining a syllogism's validity, then wrote this engine to create all possible syllogisms and determine their validity.
